#media-queries
This project demonstrates how to create responsive cards using HTML and CSS, with the help of media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
This project will create a simple webpage with a set of cards that adjust their layout based on the screen size. The cards will display in a row on larger screens and switch to a grid layout on smaller screens.
